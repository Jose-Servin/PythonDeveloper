## Static Typing

In static typing, variables are explicitly declared with their data types at compile time, and the type checking is performed at compile time.
Once a variable is declared with a specific data type, it cannot hold values of any other type. This restriction helps catch type-related errors early in the development process.
Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C, C++, and Swift.

## Dynamic Typing

In dynamic typing, variables are not bound to a specific data type at compile time. Instead, the type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it.
Type checking is typically performed at runtime, as opposed to compile time. This means that type errors might only be discovered while the program is running.
Dynamic typing provides more flexibility as variables can hold values of any type and can change their type during runtime.
Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

## Duck Typing In Python

In Python, instead of checking if an object belongs to a specific class or type, you check if it supports certain methods or behaviors. If an object implements the necessary methods or attributes, it can be used in a particular context, regardless of its actual type or class.

In `../Projects/NextLevelPython/duck_typing.py` we see the `len()` function expects an Object of type `Sized` which means this Object needs to have a `__len__()` dunder method.

[In other words](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/making-the-len-function-work-on-your-python-objects/):

```text
Python's built-in len function calls the __len__ method (pronounced "dunder len") on the object you give it.

So if that object has a __len__ method, it has a length.
```

## Type Hint/`Annotation

It's easy to add type hints in Python, we simply use the `:` and declare what type our variable is/what variables it's made of.

```python
my_str: str = "Hello World"
my_list: list[int] = [34, 54, 65, 78]
my_dict: dict[str, int] = {"one": 123, "two": 456, "three": 789}
```
